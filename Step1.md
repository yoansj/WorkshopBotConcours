In this part of the workshop you will learn basic notions about the Twitter API.

In the previous example you saw how to get tweets in your code with a call to the API with the function ```python api.get_user_timeline()```

Each call to the API is stored by Twitter and you have a minimum amount of call to the API every day.
Each call to the API is precious so be carefull when you make a call to the API. You can see all the limits on [this page](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/rate-limits).
